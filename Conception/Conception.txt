Envisioning the Future

*****Generating and Making Safe-to-Try New Ideas*****

Two things are incredibly important to gain clarity on for a team prior to the beginning of a given project.
1) Purpose
2) The Problem

It is arguable that a third component is relevant too, the Customer, but we have embedded this concept as a lower taxon within *both* Purpose and Problem.

Derrick Bradley has an excellent post discussing the structure and function of good purpose found here: http://derrickbradley.github.io/2015/03/06/making-purpose-applicable/
When we talk about The Problem, we mean a consistently experienced hurdle to our customer/user achieving an end result. This can be within an existing platform, or agnostic of any currently available solution.

As we envision, we want to do just enough thinking to produce a minimal, testable value proposistion for our customers' need.

The DAD framework reference (http://disciplinedagiledelivery.com) provides a concise working definition for testability:
"you need to identify how you are going to measure the effectiveness of the new functionality that you produce."
