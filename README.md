#project-pedagogy

Project Pedagogy is the working name for our attempt to codify some of the philosophy and practice that has given rise to our our capacity as a team.

Herein we're going to try to prescribe specific meaning to the terms we use in order to offer a clear and focused understanding of what we offer.
We expect this to benefit not only prospective clients, but members of our organization as well. This is a practice in the AMGA world known as "consolidation."
